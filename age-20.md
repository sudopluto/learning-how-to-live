- beliefs
  - life is a game, don't be afraid of messing around to learn the mechanics
    - also its very hard to hit a true "game over" in this day and age
    - it's okay just to play the game, instead of having a concrete goal you are
      trying to acheive
  - you don't have to die on this hill / there is no need to try and prove anything
    - in that vein, no need to think so hard about what others think of you
      - all it does is screw up your life
        - do things to make other's happy, even though they actually don't want it
        - your life ends up being an act, and it's annoying not to be honest with yourself
  - nothing beautiful can last forever
      - instead of trying to capture it an keep it forever, just experience and cherish it
      - if you want to experience it again, then just recreate it
  - most people are trying to do what is right
    - but most people are also just looking out for themselves
