- beliefs
  - real freedom comes from being able to the important descions based on your values, not on fears
    - values: 
      - who do you want to be
      - who do you want to support
    - fears:
      - fear of acting outside of self-image
      - fear of past experience
      - fear of acting against other's wishes (family, friends, society)
  - thoughts are not a concrete representation of reality
    - in order to act in accordance with you values you need to be able to:
      - accept your current emotions and thoughts as valid, but not as the truth  
      - understand that bad emotions (pain, fear, boredom) inevitatble,
      but exist as part of acting in accord with your values
      - trying to avoid / control pain cripples your ability to move forwards
      - accepting and living with the pain allows you to move fowards
  - life is just a game, remember to treat it like one
    - only seems important during play, returns to meaninglessness when play is stoped
    - it's okay just to play the game for fun, instead minmaxing and playing optimally
    - its very hard to hit a true "game over" in this day and age, so don't be too serious
    - what happened in the past is just lore, has very little impact on gameplay
    - as long you have some element of choice, your current situation is one of many possibilities 
  - shouldn't have to try so hard to prove self-worth / make others like you
    - things should be done / started only if these are true:
      - you deem them to be worthy / they are a depenency of something worthy
      - you have a rough idea of what you are getting into
    - living for others is bad because:
      - you bad at determining what other people actually want from you
      - living for others make you feel like a hollow shell / are wearing a mask
  - nothing beautiful can last forever
    - instead of trying to capture it an keep it forever, just experience and cherish it
    - if you want to experience it again, then just recreate it
  - on emotions:
    - friends (in trad. sense) are basiclly duct tape patches for negative emotions
      - rely on them to get rid of feelings of loneliness 
      - rely on them for entertainment when bored
      - rely on them for validation when lacking self worth
      - rely on them for affirmation when having self doubt
      - rely on them to support your excuses instead of getting your life togeather
    - the problem, is well, there is no other (complete) solution 
      - all of those emotions are part of the human condition
      - having lots of friends can't get rid of these emotions
      - introspection can't get rid of these emotions as well
    - but there is a balance of how much you rely on yourself and how much you rely on others
      - rely only on self:   
        - burdened by trying to define self 
      - rely only on others: 
        - less and less control over identity
    - its hard understand who you are without others, but the existence of others means pain 
    - relying on others to help you is selfish, but is necessary 
    - should be able to live your self as long as you make an honest effort in:
      - trying to regulate your own negative emotions on your own first
      - leaning on others only when it is necesscary
      - being there for others in return
    - introspection and friendship are two equal halfs, both are necessary 
      - taking the time to get to know yourself, and yourself is needed
      - taking the risk of getting hurt to form relationships is also needed
    - but both introspection and friendship shouldn't take over your life
      - introspection is exploring yourself and your condition
      - friendship is exploring others and experiences that can only be shared
      - work is exploring your abilities
      - learning is exploring your world
    - all of those four things are essential to avoid imploading
