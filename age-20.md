- yay, I finally turned 20, no longer a teenager baby

- beliefs
  - on the path taken in life:
    - mom and dad grew up in a whole different environment
      - you have to stay on the "yellow brick road", or you will fall through
      the cracks
    - they love me, so they wanted to make sure I understood this fact
      - so they beat it into me, so that even if I did understand it,
      at least I would know it
    - the path that is laid out for me works, as long as I work for it
    - but with the privlage I am given, I have the ability to venture off the
    path without much consequences
    - given my privlage, I have a responsibilty to explore the areas off the path
      - exploaration to explore myself and what I like
      - exploaration to confirm or deny parts of the path, to test it in combat
      - exploaration to experiment with the path, to update it for the 
      current environment
  - loving yourself means also loving the parts of you that plain old suck:
    - stuff that you are shamefull about
    - stuff that brings you pain
    - stuff that you wish just didn't exist
    - stuff that you wish you could redo or fix
  - if you can find it in you to love yourself, then you can start to properly love others,
  and recieve their love
  - so much pain comes from reflecting on your past to create a self-image (mask),
  and then trying to use that mask to decide how to shape your future
  - to try and escape this, ditch the mask and try to view self as incoherent
  - failure hurts more than staying stuck, but you can't move fowards without trying
  - real freedom comes from being able to make descions untainted from fear of pain 
  or attachment to past self-images
    - being able to come to a descion with these thoughts in mind:
      - the descion is my duty, and thus I must choose the best option that I have
      - if I am uninformed of my options and I have the time, I should get informed,
      but that is not an excuse to offload the duty onto someone else
      - the best option I have might cause me pain, and might fail, but it is my 
      duty to at least try
  - if you really chose the best option, the trigger to second guess should be
  a change in environment 
    - the trigger to second guess shouldn't be expected pain or the doubts of other people
  - inner voice is not a concrete representation of reality, just a voice.
  you can choose to listen to it
  - life is just like an rpg game, remember to treat it like one once in a while
    - only seems important during play, returns to meaninglessness when play is stoped
    - it's okay just to play the game for fun, instead minmaxing and playing optimally
    - its very hard to hit a true "game over" in this day and age, so don't be too serious
    - what happened in the past is just lore, has very little impact on gameplay
    - as long you have some element of choice, your path is one of many possibilities
    - why would you hate the protagonist if you are the protagonist? 
  - nothing beautiful can last forever
    - instead of trying to capture it an keep it forever, just experience 
    and cherish it till the end
    - if you want to experience it again, then just try to recreate it
  - on emotions:
    - friends (in trad. sense) are basiclly duct tape patches for negative emotions
      - rely on them to get rid of feelings of loneliness
      - rely on them for entertainment when bored
      - rely on them for validation when lacking self worth
      - rely on them for affirmation when having self doubt
      - rely on them to support your excuses instead of getting your life togeather
    - the problem, is well, there is no other (complete) solution
      - all of those emotions are part of the human condition
      - having lots of friends can't get rid of these emotions
      - introspection can't get rid of these emotions as well
    - but there is a balance of how much you rely on yourself and how much you rely on others
      - rely only on self:
        - burdened by trying to define self
      - rely only on others:
        - less and less control over identity
    - introspection and friendship are both valuable parts of life (that hurt)
      - taking the time to get to know yourself, and yourself is needed
      - taking the risk of getting hurt to form relationships is also needed
    - but both introspection and friendship shouldn't take over your life
      - introspection is exploring yourself and your condition
      - friendship is exploring others and experiences that can only be shared
      - work is exploring your abilities
      - learning is exploring your world
    - all of those four things are essential to avoid imploading
