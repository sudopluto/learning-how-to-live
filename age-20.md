- beliefs
  - life is just a game, remember to treat it like one
    - it's okay just to play the game for fun, instead minmaxing and playing optimally
    - its very hard to hit a true "game over" in this day and age, so don't be too serious
    - what happened in the past is just lore, has very little impact on gameplay
  - shouldn't have to try so hard to prove self-worth / make others like you
    - things should be done / started only if these are true:
      - you deem them to be worthy / they are a depenency of something worthy
      - you have a rough idea of what you are getting into
    - living for others is bad because:
      - you bad at determining what other people actually want from you
      - living for others make you feel like a hollow shell / are wearing a mask
  - nothing beautiful can last forever
    - instead of trying to capture it an keep it forever, just experience and cherish it
    - if you want to experience it again, then just recreate it
