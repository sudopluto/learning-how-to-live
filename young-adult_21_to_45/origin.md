- started thinking about my ancestors for the first time in a long while

- we just don't know that much
  - no birth records
    - hell both my grandmothers are illiterate
  - just pick a random date around the time you were born

- just simple farmers on the plains of haryana
  - small villages
  
- mom's side
  - grandad was going to have to work on the farm
  - didn't want to, joined the military instead
    - air force mechanic
      - still has models of the planes that were in service
  - went to night school though the military to become a lawyer
  - moved all around india
  - eventually got out and became a civil defender
  - just my mom her older brother
    - mom just copied her brother
      - she must have adored him
      - my Uncle worked in Japan for a bit, kinda a cool dude
    - both got smacked by grandad, he was strict
    
- dad's side
  - similar situation, but grandad became a teacher
  - lived in a small village, but then in dehli
  - one of many kids, didn't get much attention
  - had to use his brain to become someone
  - dad still loyal to his family, even though seems disconnected 
  
- before me
  - dad and mom were both computer / eletrical engineers
  - got married, mom quit job to raise kids
  - dad worked as Wipro consultant, worked all around Asia and ANZ
  - dad got job in Cali, and we moved there
  - dad found another job in Mass, and we moved there
  - rest is history
