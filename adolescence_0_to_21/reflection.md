end of my adolescence

I was struggling to come up with a format for this reflection. I mean how much
can you reflect upon the descion making of a kid? I can tell you first hand
that so many of the descions I made, descions that had profound effects on 
my life, were almost all made from a place of false truths, dogma, unbelieveable
ego, raw fear, random hormones, and just plain ignorance.

Reaching the end of adolescence feels like I somehow woke up comfy and tucked 
in my own bed after a night of heavy drinking. I don't know how I got home, or
how I didn't manage to loose anything or drunk text anyone, but at this point
I'm just glad I made it. I don't want to give it anymore thought, or question
why things turned out the way that they did.

I have to thank the adults in my life: my parents, my sister, and my teachers.
I'm sorry they had to bear with a incoherent mess like myself, but I'm glad
they didn't give up on me and tried to help me out.

I reget a lot of things. If I could go back this instant and have a do over, I
wouldn't even hesitate. But my biggest regret was ever allowing for that emotion
of helplessness ever take root.

I've gotten very very sad twice in my life. Both were related to my career.
Did I get into the right school? Will I be able to find a summer internship?
Will I be able to find a good co-op? Will I have a good career? What if I 
fucked it up beyond all repair?

It's funny I'm going to blame the same people I just thanked, but throwing
off the yoke of my parents was the best thing to happen to me. Them
setting their goals for me within their own narrow scope of what sucess is.
Beating me and verbally abusing me when I didn't meet those goals. Taking
care of all my needs so my only job was to keep my head down and
get a good gpa -> good degree -> good job -> good wife -> good family.

It took me a long time to realize that while my parents had good intentions,
they were making my mind fragil and dependent and warped.

I don't know what started to change. I want to say I decided of my own
voilition to break free, but that wouldn't be honest. I don't know if I just
keep fucking up things long enough for me to realize that the world wasn't
ending just because I wasn't performing.

I mean the best way I can explain the feeling is... intertia. That I made
enough small moves in a similar direction to actually start moving. I guess
it's kinda like that Steve Jobs quote about how you don't know if the dots
you are making in the present will connect, you'll only see with hindsight.
But it's not exactly that.

Accumulating enough rejection and failures to first hit rock bottom, and then
develop a resistence to that pain and fear. Watching enough anime and reading
enough books to start to develop your sense of philosophy and your own opinions
of what you want out of life. Coding enough that you start to respect the craft
and start to study it just to get better at it. Doing enough pull ups to get to
the point where you start to enjoy the hell out of it.

I know I probably sound cheesy. I know because I've read my fair share of self
help stuff. I was addicted, I thought if I could just find the right advice, all
my problems would be solved. The problem was that all the self-help stuff all
said the same universally accepted facts, just with different wording. Of course
working out, sleeping enough, and not procrastinating would be good for your
mood.

I even joked for a while that angsty highbrow anime was the only form of 
self-help / self-therapy the worked for me. 

What I think really happened is that anime, novels, and other stories kind of
hijack your thought process, rather than bombarding your head with stupid life
pro-tips. Experiencing the story of someone going something similar to you,
experiencing how they react. Getting so invested that you start to emphathize.

All these stories I consumed of people growing up, gave some reference. Even
if it's fiction, realizing people are going through the same thing you are.
Realizing that everyone reacts to the same situation in a different way.
That no matter what happens to me, I will always have multiple reactions
availible to me, and that if I don't pick my reaction myself, someone else
will pick it for me.

All these stories put more and more force on my brain to the point where the 
static friction was overcome and things started moving. It was that
central belief that life doesn't just happen to people, and that you always 
have to option to pursue the things you want.

You can pursue them, but you might never get them. Instead of blind faith
in yourself, a willingness to play the game and to have hope. To have a
hand in writing out your own story.

There were other things I picked up along the way. Keeping your hubris and
humility in balance.  How to say goodbye. How to accept regrets and move
on. Belief in a fluid and inconsistent identity rather than a single one 
that is steadly progressing to an ideal / final form. Using a descision
tree rather than conventional wisdom. 

All things that are probably in self-help books, but things I needed to
experience for myself. 




I think if I had to write a TL;DR for this, well I wouldn't be able to.

But Flipturn sums it up pretty much in the first few seconds of Nickel:

"Well hey, you’re okay
You’re not doing so bad
And your hair’s not grey
You, are only twenty years old
Don’t kill your soul
For your father’s gold"
