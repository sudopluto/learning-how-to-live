- dating
  - correcting for gender ratios (scuba, uk study abroad) didn't make me more attractive
    - still unattractive, undateable
  - my biggest fears
    - i will never get to experience young carefree romance
    - since im unattractive, even if i get into a relationship, she wont have any reason to stay
      - how can i compare to her ex's (espically when i have any?)
      - "it was just your turn"
      - i just want to have kids and a family man, i dont wanna get divorced
  - there is no point in me trying to date unless girls are coming up to me
    - what to focus on:
      - career: swe -> fighter pilot or national guard (try in 2023!!!)
      - hustle: youtube
      - health: mental, sleep, eating right, working out
      - hobbies: active & nerdy, balance social ones and alone ones
        - active: martial arts, hiking, scuba, climbing, intermural sports
        - nerdy: anime, linux, gaming, reading, dnd, conventions
