And now I'm torn between (and now I'm torn between)
Trying to be a better man (trying to be a better man)
Trying to accept the man I am

The people that I’ve talked to  
And the books that I’ve read  
And the TV shows and movies that I’ve seen  

Are all I have to turn to  
For learning how to live  
But when? When? When? When?  
When? When? When will I ever learn?  

- Car Seat Headrest

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna
Kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh

- Billy Joel

Like a bullet from a gun it burns  
When you realize she was never your girl  
It was just your turn  

- Skepta
