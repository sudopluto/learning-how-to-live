And now I'm torn between   
Trying to be a better man   
Trying to accept the man I am  

The people that I’ve talked to  
And the books that I’ve read  
And the TV shows and movies that I’ve seen  

Are all I have to turn to  
For learning how to live  
But when? When? When? When?  
When? When? When will I ever learn?  

- Car Seat Headrest

But you know that when the truth is told  
That you can get what you want  
Or you can just get old  
You're gonna  
Kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh  

- Billy Joel

God knows I'm not perfect, either. I've made tons of stupid mistakes, and later I regretted them.  
And I've done it over and over again, thousands of times; a cycle of hollow joy and vicious self-hatred.  
But even so, every time I learned something about myself.  

- Evangelion  

Because I've overcome the vanity and pride of being different. 
I've understood that they are a pitiful defense against being different.
Because I've understood that the sun shines differently when something changes, 
but I'm not the axis of those changes. The sun shines differently, but it will continue to shine,
and jumping at it with a hoe isn't going to do anything.
